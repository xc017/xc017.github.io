This project explores how childbirth affects women's lives across different countries, focusing on fertility trends, maternal health, and parental leave policies.

Using global datasets from the World Bank and Our World In Data, and leveraging Python (Pandas) and Tableau for analysis, the project examines both worldwide patterns and detailed trends in China.

Key Findings:
- Fertility rates have declined globally but remain high in developing regions.
- Son preference remains a significant issue in parts of Asia.
- Longer childbirth-related leave policies help but are not solely effective in reversing fertility declines.
- In China, childbirth policies (one-child, two-child, three-child) show clear impacts on birth rates.
