Hi! I’m Xingyu 👋  
This blog is part of my effort to transform a personal health journey into something that can help others take charge of their wellbeing through **data-driven decisions**.

## 🧬 Why I Started This

In 2023, followed by a emergency hospitalisation, I was diagnosed with **insulin resistance**, **fatty liver**, and a **lumbar disc herniation** that seriously affected my mobility. That was a wake-up call—and the start of a transformation.

I began studying evidence-based strategies to:
- Manage **blood glucose**
- Improve **muscle balance and spine health** through **swimming** and **Pilates**
- Track macros with a focus on **sustainable protein intake** and **balanced meals**

More than just feeling better, I wanted to understand *why* things work—and support my body with logic, not luck.

## 📱 What I’m Building

Together with my partner, I’m developing a **health tracking app** designed for people managing similar conditions.

The app aims to:
- Monitor **blood sugar-friendly meals**
- Track **macronutrients**: protein, carbs, fats
- Provide tools like:
  - ✅ **WHO BMI calculator**
  - ✅ **Protein needs calculator**
- Potentially incorporate **bioinformatics-informed nutrition guidance**

This GitHub site is where I’ll share:
- 🧮 **Interactive tools** (coming soon!)
- 📈 **Glucose analysis templates**
- 📝 **Blog posts** about lifestyle changes that actually worked
