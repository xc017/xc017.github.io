🧪 This self-driven project explores how health, lifestyle, and metabolic biomarkers relate to diabetes risk.  
As someone deeply interested in metabolic health, I built this model to understand predictive relationships within a synthetic or anonymized real-world dataset.

---

## 🔍 Dataset Features

The dataset includes common health metrics such as:

- **Age**, **Sex**, **Ethnicity**
- **BMI**, **Waist Circumference**
- **Fasting Glucose**, **HbA1c**
- **Cholesterol (HDL, LDL, Total)** and **GGT (liver enzyme)**
- **Uric acid**, **Blood pressure**
- Lifestyle factors like **Physical activity**, **Smoking**, **Alcohol**, and **Dietary intake**

Target variable: **Presence of Diabetes**

---

## 🧠 What I Explored

- Feature engineering and unit conversion
- Distribution visualization for key variables
- How factors like obesity, liver enzymes, and cholesterol interact with diabetes risk
- Early model performance comparison (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)
- Addressing class imbalance and fairness

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Certain markers like **HbA1c**, **Fasting Glucose**, and **Family History** showed strong predictive value
- Ethnicity and lifestyle differences may introduce modeling bias if not carefully treated
- Imbalanced datasets and unfair predictions for minority classes prompted me to evaluate both model performance and ethical implications

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for all analysis
- Visualization techniques for distributions and correlation mapping

## 💬 Personal Note

This project was part of my continuous learning in applying data science to meaningful real-world problems — especially related to public health and chronic disease prevention.  
It also connects to my personal interest in metabolic wellness, nutrition, and algorithm fairness.
