This university project analyzed SARS-CoV-2 proteinâ€“protein interactions and host cell responses during infection, using datasets from Gordon et al. (2020) and Bojkova et al. (2020). Key analyses included:

### ðŸ”¬ Key Components:
- **PPI Analysis**: Used NSP2 viral protein as bait, identified interacting human proteins, and performed enrichment using Panther and GProfiler.
- **Proteomics**: Tracked host response at 2h, 6h, 10h, and 24h, revealing suppression in metabolic and structural pathways.
- **Translateomics**: Detected early viral takeover of translation machinery at 24h.

### ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques:
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib (via Jupyter)
- Panther, GProfiler
- Volcano plots, correlation matrices, gene filtering

### ðŸ§  Summary of Findings:
- NSP2 may disrupt ATP production and structural maintenance
- Viral protein synthesis rapidly outpaced host responses
- Exosome-related protein suppression hinted at blocked cell communication
