Hi, Iâ€™m Xingyu â€” a data-driven problem solver passionate about using analytics to improve lives. I hold a finance degree and am currently finishing my Master of Data Science. I specialize in uncovering insights using Python, SQL, Tableau, and statistical modeling.

Iâ€™m actively building:

- A portfolio of real-world data projects  
- A bioinformatics + glucose-control health app with a growing community on Rednote  
- Content on Medium to share tips, breakdowns, and visual storytelling

My goal is to land a role as a **Data Analyst**, **Business Analyst**, or **Financial Analyst**, where I can apply my skills to solve meaningful problems.
